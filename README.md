# üè• Patient Management System

The Patient Management System is a comprehensive application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It allows for efficient scheduling and management of patient appointments. The system integrates with Twilio to send SMS notifications when appointments are scheduled, and uses Shadcn and Tailwind CSS to create complex forms and a modern user interface. Appwrite serves as the backend database, providing real-time data management. An admin page is included for real-time appointment approval, modification, or cancellation.
